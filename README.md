This project demostrates how to perform regression analysis and statistical inference using a more compact
and easily to follow method. Compared to the traditional method where one uses base R functions to compute
coefficients and test statistics, using opinionated packages like `modelsummary` and `infer` make 
exploration and presentation of results easier.
